     title="Vision"
     description="VR technology and Metaverse platforms will reach their true potential in the coming years. Leading the effort are tech giants like Meta, formerly known as Facebook, who continue to invest billions of dollars in developing more inexpensive, higher-performing gear that expands capabilities while improving the user's immersion experience. Along with delivering enhanced ergonomic design to produce a smooth experience and allow VR devices to be used for long-term use sessions. When these hurdles are no longer discernible, the general market will adopt these products, allowing the utility and use cases to reveal themselves. That's where 3MetaD comes in; once these venues are flourishing, the market will require a constant supply of new material to keep this ecosystem alive and growing. Large studio chains, smaller indie teams, and individual artists who can transport their products to these markets will satisfy this need. We are here to provide users with products ranging from Mini games, 3D and physical merchandise, In-game merchandise, NFT collections, characters, architectures, and custom orders to external parties.
